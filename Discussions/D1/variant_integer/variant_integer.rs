// Each variant of an enum type has a unique and constant integral discriminator value. If no explicit discriminator is specified for a variant, the value defaults to the value of the previous variant plus one. If the first variant does not have a discriminator, it defaults to 0.  

// you can cast a variant to an integer, which can be used as index when you refer to an element of a vector
